# PyQt5-Webbrowser
A web browser designed taking advantage of the PyQt5 Python3 library. This has a direct URL bar which doubles as a search bar. The code was based on the code featured in a NeuralNine YouTube tutorial.

#Instructions

If PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine aren't installed, then simply run the Installer.py file. This interacts with the command prompt or terminal, and installs the required libraries. Once installed, this program will be ready to use.

If you want to use Google as the default search engine, then you don't need to edit anything. Otherwise, if you want to change the search engine, then open the Webbrowser.py program with an IDE, and then scroll down to #Settings - Find the variable 'SearchEngine' and change the URL in the quotation marks to that of the Search Engine you wish to switch to. Once changed, simply press Ctrl+S to save the file, close it and then run it, and it'll load into the Search Engine you have changed it to.

(Beware, some search engines do not use the same URL-search format as Google, so some may not work when you search using the URL bar. This issue will be resolved in Version 0.4 and up.)

UPDATE Version 0.2:

- One feature added; You can now change the search engine used. Simply open the program using your preferred IDE, go down to the #Settings section, find the variable 'SearchEngine'
and replace the Google URL with the URL of the Search Engine you wish to use.
